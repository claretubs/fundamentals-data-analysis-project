## **Background**
### Tasks

### Project
The **Iris flower data set**, otherwise known as **Fishers Iris data set**, is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistcian and biologist [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis*. [Multivariate statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics) is a branch of statistics that deals with the analysis of multiple variables at the same time. It involves studying various types of multivariate analysis and their relationships with each other. This data set has since been widely used for pattern recognition and classification tasks in various fields, including machine learning, statistics, and biology.
